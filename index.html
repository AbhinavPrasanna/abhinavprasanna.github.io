								<p>XPM 5 was a web application developed by Wells Fargo technology teams to allow buisness services to handle customer side information easier. </p>
								<p>In this project, I was responsible for creating a grid-view and search bar component. In the grid view component, the component was created to display the user information from a table by implementing the Kendo Grid UI and it would take information using the subscription method for Angular. I created different loops to show information based on what and how much data we had. For our searchview component, I implemented an autocomplete feature from the Kendo AutoComplete UI and created a search algorithim so that our search would filter data based on what the user is entering. In addition, I used Jasmine and Karma for implementing unit test cases for both of these components to test each method's functionality. Additionally, I used Karma to check the code coverage.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, this project is not allowed to be on an Open Github Repository so I provided a description to this application.</p>

								<p>Home to Home was an application developed by a couple of college students out from California, North Carolina, and even India. Home to Home is an application that was hoped to allow user to add items that they won't use that could be sold to other people or traded. We developed this application on Android Studio and incorporated Google FireStore for user authentication and for storing our data. fI did backend development on this application helping format our FireStore database and providing the query for our Database. I was responsible for passing data through our different pages in Android Studio and making sure they met our requirements for that page.</p>

								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Hey everyone, my name is Abhinav Prasanna and I am a college student currently living in the Bay Area. I originally studied at the University of California, Merced but I transferred to the University of California, Santa Cruz pursing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.  As a middle schooler, I grew an interest in computers and how they operated. I enjoyed reading literature about Alan Turing and how he came to invent the first Computer.</p>
								<p> Growing up, I wanted to pursue other passions such as music through my time in concert and marching band during my time in High School where I played the Trombone. I also wanted to pursue volunteer work which I did through Red Cross by doing volunteer work in Blood Centers and even hosting my own Blood Drive.</p>
								<p> I am interested in learning about the enterprise world and in building on my skills as a programmer. During the past summer, I was fortunate to intern at Wells Fargo where I learned about the technology department and essential skills required to get a job in Wells Fargo. As I elaborated in my project section, I was given the opportunity to get practical experience through the Wells Fargo project XPM 5. I worked in a team consisting of Software Engineers and Business Services employees where we utilized Agile and Scrum to structure our Software Development lifecycle. Wells Fargo allowed to be apart of an amazing 11 week experience where I got to learn about the interworkings of enterprise companies in the technology department.</p>
								<p> Currently, I am pursing internship opportunities to learn more about the enterprise world and to build on my skils as a programmer. I want to build on the internships I have done in the past along with my previous academic work. On the side, I love to pursue passion projects on the side like filmmaking or environmental activism to help build a connection with my community. I want to create a better connection in my communities and strive to do work that helps other people wherever my career might land me.</p>

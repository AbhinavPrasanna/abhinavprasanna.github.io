								<p>XPM 5 was a web application developed by Wells Fargo technology teams to allow buisness services to handle customer side information easier. </p>
								<p>In this project, I was responsible for creating a grid-view and search bar component. In the grid view component, the component was created to display the user information from a table by implementing the Kendo Grid UI and it would take information using the subscription method for Angular. I created different loops to show information based on what and how much data we had. For our searchview component, I implemented an autocomplete feature from the Kendo AutoComplete UI and created a search algorithim so that our search would filter data based on what the user is entering. In addition, I used Jasmine and Karma for implementing unit test cases for both of these components to test each method's functionality. Additionally, I used Karma to check the code coverage.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, this project is not allowed to be on an Open Github Repository so I provided a description to this application.</p>

								<p>iWare is an application developed by several interns in the Cognizant Digital Engineering Unit during our time in the internship. The application was built to allow users to shop for several glasses from various brands. In addition, users were able to try on different glass frames on the application using AR technology. Users are able to add and remove glasses from a cart with the page refereshing automatically. The application was built with React Native for the frontend and Springboot for the backend with the backend service being deployed to Google Cloud. The backend was run through Sonarcube for quality testing. IP addresses were created through Google Cloud to allow for easy communication fetching data and pushing data from the frontend to the backend.</p>
								<p>Unforunately, I am unable to share the code due to NDA.</p>

								<p>Home to Home was an application developed by a couple of college students out from California, North Carolina, and even India. Home to Home is an application that was hoped to allow user to add items that they won't use that could be sold to other people or traded. We developed this application on Android Studio and incorporated Google FireStore for user authentication and for storing our data. I did backend development on this application helping format our FireStore database and providing the query for our Database. I was responsible for passing data through our different pages in Android Studio and making sure they met our requirements for that page.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Profile Picture 2_edited.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Hi, my name is Abhinav Prasanna and I'm a college student living in the Bay Area. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz after transferring from the University of California, Merced. My interest in computers began in middle school, where I was inspired by literature on Alan Turing and his invention of the first computer.</p>
								<p> In addition to my academic pursuits, I also have a passion for music and volunteering. In high school, I played the trombone in concert and marching band, and volunteered at the Red Cross by organizing blood drives.</p>
								<p> Last summer, I had the opportunity to intern at Wells Fargo where I worked on project XPM 5 with a team of software engineers and business services employees. Through this experience, I gained valuable skills in Agile and Scrum software development practices and learned about the inner workings of enterprise technology departments.</p>
								<p> Currently, I am seeking internship opportunities to further develop my skills as a programmer and build on my past experiences. Outside of academics and work, I enjoy pursuing passion projects like filmmaking and environmental activism to connect with my community and make a positive impact. Ultimately, I hope to find a career that allows me to help others and make a difference in my community.</p>

								<p>XPM 5 was a web application developed by Wells Fargo technology teams to allow buisness services to handle customer side information easier. </p>
								<p>In this project, I was responsible for creating a grid-view and search bar component. In the grid view component, the component was created to display the user information from a table by implementing the Kendo Grid UI and it would take information using the subscription method for Angular. I created different loops to show information based on what and how much data we had. For our searchview component, I implemented an autocomplete feature from the Kendo AutoComplete UI and created a search algorithim so that our search would filter data based on what the user is entering. In addition, I used Jasmine and Karma for implementing unit test cases for both of these components to test each method's functionality. Additionally, I used Karma to check the code coverage.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, this project is not allowed to be on an Open Github Repository so I provided a description to this application.</p>

								<p>iWare is an application developed by several interns in the Cognizant Digital Engineering Unit during our time in the internship. The application was built to allow users to shop for several glasses from various brands. In addition, users were able to try on different glass frames on the application using AR technology. Users are able to add and remove glasses from a cart with the page refereshing automatically. The application was built with React Native for the frontend and Springboot for the backend with the backend service being deployed to Google Cloud. The backend was run through Sonarcube for quality testing. IP addresses were created through Google Cloud to allow for easy communication fetching data and pushing data from the frontend to the backend.</p>
								<p>Unforunately, I am unable to share the code due to NDA.</p>

								<p>Home to Home was an application developed by a couple of college students out from California, North Carolina, and even India. Home to Home is an application that was hoped to allow user to add items that they won't use that could be sold to other people or traded. We developed this application on Android Studio and incorporated Google FireStore for user authentication and for storing our data. I did backend development on this application helping format our FireStore database and providing the query for our Database. I was responsible for passing data through our different pages in Android Studio and making sure they met our requirements for that page.</p>

								<p>This is the sample Minecraft World generated in 3js. I had to resize the canvas to a significantly smaller size so users could interact with the model on the website. The link for the 3js model in full aspect ratio is below. I have a full breakdown of the 3js model in the next page. I have also attached the Github Repository if you would like to look at the source code. </p>

								<h2 class="major">A breakdown of the world</h2>
								<p>In this world, there are more than 20 objects where 30+ of them are cubes, 4 objects are cylinders, and one object is an Icosahedron. The minecraft grass, diamond ,glowstone blocks, and four pillars were made by me in 3js using textures from the Minecraft game itself but built with 3-dimensional cubes in 3js. I incorporated interleaving when creating the little grass wall around the world when initializing every grass block if you look at the source code. The skybox is fully 3-dimensional with image assets found online but created through 3js. There are 4 light sources: a directional light so that shadows cast a certain way, a hemisphere light to cast a generic light on the map, a spotlight on specific characters that is rotated based on the camera, and directed cube light for the little glowstone blocks that show the glow at the bottom. There is fog on the map that is centered around the Icosahedron near the four pillars. The objects that are imported into the project are not OBJ objects but rather GLTF objects as they have a higher resolution texture imported from Unity where I imported a GLTF texture from the loaders website from Threejs. </p>

								<p>Hi my name is Abhinav Prasanna and I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of California, Santa Cruz, currently training as a Full Stack Developer at Cognizant. My experience includes internships at Wells Fargo, where I honed my skills in Agile and Scrum development practices, and Cognizant, where I worked on the iWare project, developing in React Native for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. I'm eager to expand my technology stack and build upon my existing expertise.</p>

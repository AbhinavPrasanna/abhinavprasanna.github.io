								<p>XPM 5 was a web application developed by Wells Fargo technology teams to allow buisness services to handle customer side information easier. </p>
								<p>In this project, I was responsible for creating a grid-view and search bar component. In the grid view component, the component was created to display the user information from a table by implementing the Kendo Grid UI and it would take information using the subscription method for Angular. I created different loops to show information based on what and how much data we had. For our searchview component, I implemented an autocomplete feature from the Kendo AutoComplete UI and created a search algorithim so that our search would filter data based on what the user is entering. In addition, I used Jasmine and Karma for implementing unit test cases for both of these components to test each method's functionality. Additionally, I used Karma to check the code coverage.</p>

								<p>Home to Home was an application developed by a couple of college students out from California, North Carolina, and even India. Home to Home is an application that was hoped to allow user to add items that they won't use that could be sold to other people or traded. We developed this application on Android Studio and incorporated Google FireStore for user authentication and for storing our data. fI did backend development on this application helping format our FireStore database and providing the query for our Database. I was responsible for passing data through our different pages in Android Studio and making sure they met our requirements for that page.</p>

							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My name is Abhinav Prasanna and I am a Junior majoring in Computer Science out of the University of California, Santa Cruz. I was born in Hayward, California in Kaiser Permanente. I grew an interest in computers and how they operated on the Software side in Middle School. I really enjoyed reading literature about Alan Turing and how he came to invent the first Computer.</p>
								<p> Growing up, I wanted to pursue other passions such as music through my time in concert and marching band during my time in High School where I played the Trombone. I also wanted to pursue volunteer work which I did Red Cross through Blood Center volunteer work and even getting to host my own Blood Drive.</p>
								<p> Currently, I am pursing different internship opportunities to learn more about the enterprise world and to build on my skils as a programmer. I want to build on the internships I have done in the past along with my previous academic work. I love to pursue passion projects on the side like filmmaking or environmental activism to help build a connection with my community. I want to create a better connection in my communities and strive to do work that helps other people.</p>
